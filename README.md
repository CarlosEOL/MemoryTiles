# MemoryTiles
 Dynamic Array with Nested Vectors, Memory Allocation and User IO.


## Summary

Since I'm making this game alone, I want to see it to fruition.
I will add enough UXR such as actual graphics using a graphic library like GLFW instead of a simple console in later stages.

There are some logical errors that I'm running into but the entirety of the code is bug free, 
if you get X too many times the game gets harder, and if you keep getting the content of the grid right you can continue popping the 0s.
